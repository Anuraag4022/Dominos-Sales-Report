# Dominos-Sales-Report
Tools Used:1)Excel for data cleaning
          2) SQL for finding insights
          3) Power BI for creating dashboard
          
 In this project I have crated SQL analysis to find insights in Dominos Sales Dataset .
First of all I cleaned the raw dataset of Dominos Sales csv file by using excel. By importing that dataset into SQL find the trends and insights like Highest selling Pizas by Location, Monthwise Sales , Which Months have low sales etc .
After that finding i have created Power BI report to showcase the trend by using line chart,Pie chart etc
